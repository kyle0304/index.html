            For our third project, we had to animate a short video using Adobe Animate. We could have made anything, but giben the nature of my previous projects, I knew what I had to make a trailer for my Avengers movie. I didn't have to create any new graphics since I already had everything I wanted to animate and the only new elements I needed to incorporate were the sounds I used.
