            For our first project, we were tasked with creating a collage in Adobe Photoshop using multiple visual elements. There were no creative limitations on what we could make, so at first I was a little stumped on what to create given <em>all</em> the options I had.

            I drew inspiration from my love for the Marvel movies and decided to depict myself as the villain, Thanos, from <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>. For this project I really wanted to go for a movie poster look. I made the title myself and rendered the flat text into a 3-D object to try to get as close to the real thing as possible.
