            For our second project we were assigned to make a character using vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator and incorporate it into our raster project collage. Since my raster project was a movie poster for my Avengers movie, naturally I needed to have an Avenger in it, so who better to make than Iron Man.

            When creating the vector drawing I imported a Google image of Iron Man into Illustrator and lowered it's opacity in order to use it as a template. I used the template to carefully trace the shape and details of Iron Man to create an accurate drawing of the hero. I created my own drawings for the rocket flares at his feet and the laser beam coming from his hand.
